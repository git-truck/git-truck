# Git Truck ðŸš›

Get a truckload of visualizations for your git repository, and find out if your project has a good [truck factor](https://www.agileadvice.com/2005/05/15/agilemanagement/truck-factor/)!

Git Truck gives an overview of your folder-structure, which users have contributed most to which files, and more.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

To use Git Truck, you will need to have the following programs installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16.13 or newer
- npm 6.14 or newer
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 2.29 or newer

To check if these programs are installed, and what version you have, run `node --version`, `npm --version` and `git --version`. If any of these are not install on your system, or are just very old, they can be installed from the links above. Note that `npm` is installed along with `node`.

## [Get started](#get-started)

1. Within a git repository, or a directory containing git repositories, run the command `npx git-truck@latest`.
2. Press `y` if it asks you to download the package.
3. The application will now open in your default browser.

If you have any suggestions about new features, or things that you think should be different, also feel free to open an issue.

## [Advanced use](#advanced-use)

```

### [Configuration](#configuration)

You can add a `truckconfig.json` file to the root of your project, where you can define the arguments you want.
Additionally you can define which git-aliases should be considered as the same person using `unionedAuthors`. If provided, the first name in the array is used as the name of the person.
You can also define files to ignore.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "log": "debug",
  "branch": "main",
  "unionedAuthors": [
    ["Bob", "Bobby Bob"],
    ["Alice", "aliiii", "alice alice"]
  ],
  "hiddenFiles": ["package-lock.json", "*.bin", "*.svg"],
  "invalidateCache": false
}
```
