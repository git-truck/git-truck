# Prototype 1

This is a folder visualization prototype.


This project uses yarn to install dependencies and `yarn.lock` as a lockfile, so please do not commit `package-lock.json` to this folder. When adding new dependencies, please use `yarn add <package>` instead of `npm install <package>`.`

## Running

Start by running `yarn` or `npm install` in the root of this folder.

Then, use `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Debug mode

A debug mode can be enabled by adding `?debug=true` to the URL.
